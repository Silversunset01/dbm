# How to create a SAY command
[In Another Channel](#in-another-channel) | [In the Same Channel](#in-the-same-channel)

If you'd like to be able to type a message and speak as the bot, it's quite simple. 

## In another channel 
This example assumes that you will make the bot speak in *another* channel from the one you type into. The command would be `(p)say #channel <message>`

**1. Store the text you'd like the bot to repeat**
