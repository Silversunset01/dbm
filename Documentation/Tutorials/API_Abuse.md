## Why won't anyone help me make a kick/ban/dm all command?
Inviting your bot to a server and then using it to kick, ban, or DM all users is an abuse of your bot and violates the Discord TOS.  see below for more info. 

## Can I have my bot DM all users in a server?
No, this is a violation of the Discord TOS and may result in your account being banned. Please see this helpful communication from Discord staff regarding this:

## Can I make rainbow roles?
No. This is API abuse and is not allowed by the Discord API. [More information on rate limits can be found here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits). More specifically because of [this](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/legal) from the Discord TOS:  

`2.7 Rate Limits. You will not attempt to exceed or circumvent limitations on access to and use of the SDK or API, exceed or circumvent any limitation on the API calls you may make, or otherwise use the SDK or API in a manner that exceeds reasonable request volume, or constitutes excessive or abusive usage (“Rate Limits”). If Discord, in its sole discretion, determines that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent Rate Limits, or other controls that limit use of the SDK or API, then your ability to use the SDK or API may be temporarily suspended or permanently blocked.`

## Why won't my bot status change?
If you are changing your bots playing/watching/listening status more than 5x per minute you are spamming the API and you have most likely been rate-limited by discord.
