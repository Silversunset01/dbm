# How to take a Screenshot in Windows 
When requesting support, you will most likely be asked to send a screenshot of what you are seeing. Please, for the love of sanity, DO NOT use your phone to take a photo of your screen. Most of the time this is unreadable and we really don't want to try and see your program through the glare or fog.
