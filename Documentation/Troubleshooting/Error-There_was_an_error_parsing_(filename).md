2. Open the DATA folder  
3. Open the file that is erroring (`players.json` etc)  
4. Enter `{ }`, save and close the file  
5. Restart your bot  

## If your file is not empty
1. Launch Steam  
2. Open Software Library section  
3. Right-click on DBM and select Properties from the menu  
4. Select the Local files tab  
5. Click the Verify integrity of game files button.  
6. Steam will verify the game's files - this process may take several minutes.
